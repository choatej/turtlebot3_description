# Turtlebot3 Robot Description in ROS2/RVIZ2

This project is adapting the ROS1 turtlebot project and moving parts of it to ROS2

## what works
1. URDF/xacro processing
1. launch file
1. robot main body in rviz

## what's not working
1. robot wheels in rviz (need joint state publisher)
1. Gazebo

## What's next?
Once the robot renders properly in Gazebo and rviz2, we'll get some simulations running
using the nav2 stack.
