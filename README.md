# Turtlebot3 Robot Description in ROS2/RVIZ2

This project is adapting the ROS1 turtlebot project and moving parts of it to ROS2

## What works
1. URDF/xacro processing
1. Launch file
1. Robot main body in rviz
1. Robot in gazebo

## What's not working
All looks good for now

## What's next?
- Add joint state publisher to gazebo urdf
- Add materials path to launch file? ref- my box bot
- Check tf for correct linkages
- Review urdf, complaints on inconsistent joints?
- Test teleop once Gazebo is sorted out
- Using the nav2 stack cartographer create a map
